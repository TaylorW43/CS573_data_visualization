The data shown here comes from 
[Privatization of Space](https://gist.github.com/TaylorW43/25908e7fbe9def43d82d879c774e531d).

This chart meant to show each year which month the launch occurs. The Y menu only has one choice which is Month attribute, the X menu grouped years into groups.

In the future I wish to add dynamic mark radius, the larger the number of launches each month, the larger the radius. Right now it just shows that at this specific month in this specific year it has at least 1 launches.
