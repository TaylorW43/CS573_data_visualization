This is a remake of my old "Total Number of Rockets Throughout The Years project". The old one uses vega lite and this one uses react and D3.

The data shown here comes from 
[Privatization of Space](https://gist.github.com/TaylorW43/25908e7fbe9def43d82d879c774e531d).

This chart meant to show the answer to "Total Number of Rockets Throughout The  Years". The Y-axis is the number and X-axis shows the year.
