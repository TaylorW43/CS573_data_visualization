# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [Kaggle Privatization of Space dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/davidroberts13/one-small-step-for-data).

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 

First one is a bar chart showing the total number of launches throughout the years. The X axis is the years and Y axis shows the number of launches for that year.

Second one is a also a bar chart, but it aims to show that for each country, what's the ratio of state launches and private launches. The X axis represented all the countries that exist in the dataset, and the Y axis shows for that particular country, the number of state launches and the number of private launches, these two numbers are stacked on top of each other and represented in different colors to give a more "ratio" sense.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (Add an overlap with the number of launches each year chart) As we can see in the chart, there's some years that the number of launches are significantly more than others, I'm wondering is there a relationship between economic advancement and more launches?
 * (Add a more catagorize in the ratio of private and state launch chart) In this chart, I want to add another category that roughly represents the political ideology of each country, and try to find out is the hypothesis: capitalist countries has more private launches?
 * (Create a world graph) I also want to create a world graph that marks the location of the each individual launch location and try to find if there's something interesting about it.
 * (Create a pie chart) Another idea about this dataset is a pie chart showing that for each company, what percent of all the countries they have worked with? This idea is inspired by the author of the dataset, the author is interested in finding out which company is the most collaborative and this inspired me to create this pie chart.
 * (Create a graph showing for each country what's the success/failure ratio throughout the years) I'm very curious about with all these launches which ones are actually successful.

## Sketches



(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
