# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [Kaggle Privatization of Space dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/davidroberts13/one-small-step-for-data).

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 

First one is a bar chart showing the total number of launches throughout the years. The X axis is the years and Y axis shows the number of launches for that year.

Second one is a also a bar chart, but it aims to show that for each country, what's the ratio of state launches and private launches. The X axis represented all the countries that exist in the dataset, and the Y axis shows for that particular country, the number of state launches and the number of private launches, these two numbers are stacked on top of each other and represented in different colors to give a more "ratio" sense.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
