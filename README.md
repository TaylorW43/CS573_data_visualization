# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [Kaggle Privatization of Space dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/davidroberts13/one-small-step-for-data).

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 

First one is a bar chart showing the total number of launches throughout the years. The X axis is the years and Y axis shows the number of launches for that year.

[![concept1](<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63271980/94351007-4fa47c80-0022-11eb-8c81-db530b72dac8.png>

Second one is a also a bar chart, but it aims to show that for each country, what's the ratio of state launches and private launches. The X axis represented all the countries that exist in the dataset, and the Y axis shows for that particular country, the number of state launches and the number of private launches, these two numbers are stacked on top of each other and represented in different colors to give a more "ratio" sense.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (Add a more catagorize in the ratio of private and state launch chart) In this chart, I want to add another category that roughly represents the political ideology of each country, and try to find out is the hypothesis: capitalist countries has more private launches?
 * (Create a world graph) I also want to create a world graph that marks the location of the each individual launch location and try to find if there's something interesting about it.
 * (Create a pie chart) Another idea about this dataset is a pie chart showing that for each company, what percent of all the countries they have worked with? This idea is inspired by the author of the dataset, the author is interested in finding out which company is the most collaborative and this inspired me to create this pie chart.
 * (Still undecided whether to do this or not.)(Create a graph showing for each country what's the success/failure ratio throughout the years) I'm very curious about with all these launches which ones are actually successful.
 * (Perfect the plot with menu visulization) In the plot launch year/month with menus project, I wish to add dynamic mark radius, the larger the number of launches each month, the larger the radius. Right now it just shows that at this specific month in this specific year it has at least 1 launches.

## Sketches

###Sketch_1
![sketch1](<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63271980/94375137-770d4f00-00df-11eb-942d-4e5944f0e280.png>
)
Description:
In this sketch, the X axis is the year, and the Y axis is the number of launches in that paticular year. I haven't decided whether or not to add more to it since I decided to combine this one with the Plot with menu visualization.

###Sketch_2
![sketch2](<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63271980/94375141-87bdc500-00df-11eb-9d58-8188c99691d9.png>
)
Description:
In this sketch, I intend to create a world map and each dot would represent a launch place. When clicked on it it should say the origin country, the date of the launch and exact place along with success/failure tag. I'm curious if the launches took place more in desert or sea? Which would solve Question&Task #2.

###Sketch_3
![sketch3](<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63271980/94375148-96a47780-00df-11eb-9243-2b688cf356d9.png>
)
Description:
In this sketch, the X axis is the Countries Categorization, and the Y axis is the number of private launches and number of state luaunches. I want to add the political ideaology of these countries, although I haven't decided in what form. Which would solve Question&Task #1.

###Sketch_4
![sketch4](<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63271980/94375155-a15f0c80-00df-11eb-885a-d8a062e09722.png>
)
Description:
This is a delicious pie. Bon appétit! The pie is all the countries in the world as a whole, and each slice represents the percent of the pie that each company gets. Which would solve Question&Task #3.

###Sketch_5
![sketch5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63271980/95107264-ac312700-0707-11eb-9046-4f17626b69a2.png)
Description:
This is a newly added sketch idea inspired by "Add a menu" project. This chart meant to show in a specific year during which month the launch occurs. Currently the Y menu only has one choice which is Month attribute, the X menu grouped years into groups, but in the future I might add more into the mix. Which would solve Question&Task #5.

## Schedule of Deliverables
I plan to have two phases to finish the final project.
### First Phase---Rough visulization(two weeks)
- Sketch_1
  *Since the rough visualization of this one is already been done. This one won't cost time.
### Second Phase---Perfect each idea(two weeks)
